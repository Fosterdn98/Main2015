/**
 * Robot extends the IterativeRobot class.
 *
 * This class will be laid out such that each function will only contain the execution method for classes in the robotFunctions and
 * robotHardware packages.The objective here is to make our program more modular, improve ease to debug, and minimize req. resources.
 *
 * To Do List -- add code as necessary for the function of the robot.
 * 
 * robotInit() -- provide for initialization at robot power-on.
 *
 * init() functions -- each of the following functions is called once at robot power-on:
 * 
 *  - Drive.init()   -- initializes all resources necessary for driving.
 *  - Roborio.init() -- initializes all resources necessary for RoboRio manangement and monitoring.
 *
 * auton() functions -- each of these functions is called iteratively during autonomous mode at a frequency of 50 times per second.
 *  
 *  - Drive.auton()   -- executes the desired driving actions in autonomous mode.
 *  - Roborio.auton() -- manages and monitors the RoboRio in autonomous mode.
 *   
 * telop() functions -- each of these functions is called iteratively during teleoperated mode at a frequency of 50 times per second.
 * 
 *  - Drive.teleop()   -- executes the desired driving actions in teleop mode.
 *  - Roborio.teleop() -- manages and monitors the RoboRio in teleop mode.
 *  
 * test() functions -- each of these functions is called iteratively during test mode at a frequency of 50 times per second.
 * 
 *  - Drive.test()   -- provides programmers with useful diagnostic information about Drive.
 *  - Roborio.test() -- manages and monitors the RoboRio in test mode.
