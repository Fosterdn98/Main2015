/**
 * This class will contain the relevant code to control and monitor Talon SRX Motor Controllers in each of the four main functions.
 * Objective is to provide a class for easily interfacing and controlling Talon SRX Motor Controllers, especially on the CAN bus.
 *
 * To Do List -- It is confirmed that will are using Talon SRX's. Add the code from WPILib docs, there are around 20 commands.
 * 
 * init() -- provide resources necessary for managing Talon SRX's.
 *
 * auton() -- performs the necessary Talon SRX operations in autonomous mode.
 * 
 * teleop() --  performs the necessary Talon SRX operations in teleoperated mode.
 * 
 * test() -- provide programmers with useful diagnostic information.
