/** @b Objectives and formatting - 
 *  This class will contain the relevant code to control and monitor the Power Distribution Panel in each of the four main functions.
 *  Objective is to provide a class for easily interfacing and controlling the Power Distribution Panel, especially using the CAN bus
 *  to monitor voltages and output voltages to the smartdashboard using the Driverstation.java class.
 */ 
/** @b To do list - Add voltage monitoring and output voltages to Driverstation.java. We might also add code to analyze voltages, cross-reference
 *  them with past measurements, and use the resulting information to determine battery percentages and give drivers warnings.
