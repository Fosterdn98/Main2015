/** Objectives and formatting -

/** To do list - 
 *  Add necessary code to the driverlog() function in order to output certain variables to the smartdashboard in a scolling text box. 
 *  Currently, at the bare minimum we should get a boolean to every robotHardware class that checks if the system is online. In each 
 *  of the four main functions, we need to get the variables relevant for that stage of the match, an example being getting sensor
 *  values during the auton() function, but not anytime else unless useful to the driver.
