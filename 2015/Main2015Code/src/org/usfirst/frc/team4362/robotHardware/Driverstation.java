/**
 * This class will contain the relevant code to output to the driverstation in each of the four main functions, with secondary 
 * functions managing the actual logging and updating the smartdashboard.
 *
 * To Do List -- Add necessary code to the driverlog() function in order to output certain variables to the smartdashboard in a 
 * scolling text box. Currently, at the bare minimum we should get a boolean to every robotHardware class that checks if the system 
 * is online. In each of the four main functions, we need to get the variables relevant for that stage of the match, an example being
 * getting sensor values during the auton() function, but not anytime else unless useful to the driver.
 * 
 * init() -- provide resources necessary for managing the Driverstation..
 *
 * auton() -- updates the Driverstation in autonomous.
 * 
 * teleop() -- updates the Driverstation in teleoperated.
 * 
 * test() -- provide programmers with useful diagnostic information.
 * 
 * driverlog() -- manages the driverlog on the Driverstation.
