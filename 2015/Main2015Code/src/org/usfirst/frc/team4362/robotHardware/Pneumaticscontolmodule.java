/**
 * This class will contain the relevant code to control and monitor the Pneumatics Control Module in each of the four main functions.
 * Objective is to provide a class for easily interfacing and controlling the Pneumatics Control Module, especially on the CAN bus.
 *
 * To Do List -- Figure out if we will be needing any Pneumatics this year before spending more time on this class.
 * 
 * init() -- provide resources necessary for managing the Pneumaticscontolmodule.
 *
 * auton() -- performs the necessary Pneumatic operations in autonomous mode.
 * 
 * teleop() --  executes the necessary Pneumatic output in teleoperated mode.
 * 
 * test() -- provide programmers with useful diagnostic information.
